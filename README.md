iSee is
=======

- a set of notions ( loose and independent of each other ) that once bound together can help us better organize our data.
- is opiniated, may be.
- about giving value to point of view and beholder of point of view.
- a universal database schema/model
- a standard to represent data. a standardized data structure.
- a graph with some constraint/rules ( if talking descrete mathematic )
- a standard query language
   - some usability win in terms of quering database ?
- as inverse of how objects in OOPs is concieved to be encapsulation of attibutes/characteristics. Here, in iSee, the entity ( as resource that lies some where else and thought as blob/URI - assuming it is represented in digital format for now ) don't hold any attibutes to itself and they are just tagged/categorized/annonated upon. In fact, the tagging is special in the sense not just the value (some text) to the tag is assigned but also the ```POV``` is mentioned (as text). E.g. a youtube video will not be tagged as ```jazz``` but will be tagged ```genre:jazz```.
- a computational model ?
- a data structure that can be ideally created/represented/formulated in primary memory, secondary storage, specialized processors, out in tangible world, on paper, in minds of humans, in different kind of computing paradigms and their implementations ?
